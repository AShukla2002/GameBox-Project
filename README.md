# GameBox-Project

This is my Project called GameBox. This was a fun project to work on, i learnt a lot of things by doing this project.
I started this project as my Mini Project for my college degree in 3rd Semester, but ended up still doing some work on it. But now this is the final version of this project. No more changes will be made from my side to it.

#### Libraries needed to run the project
Make sure to use the Latest version of each
1. PyGame
2. tkinter
3. numpy
All other libraries are built-in.

The images and music were not created by me, i downloaded them from the internet, feel free to change to according to you.
